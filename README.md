# DATA 555 Final Project

Created by Jiawen Shi

## Description

This repository contains an interactive dashboard that visualizes trends in **sarcopenia** (muscle loss) and **frailty** among persons living with HIV (PLWH) who are treated with integrase strand-transfer inhibitors (INSTIs). The dashboard uses longitudinal cohort data from the MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study to compare:

* Median grip strength and gait speed over time by INSTI use  
* Individual frailty indicators (weight loss, weakness, exhaustion, slow gait, low activity)

Insights gained here can inform clinical screening and intervention strategies to improve quality of life for PLWH on INSTI regimens.

## Usage

1. Open `sarcopenia_dashboard.Rmd` in RStudio.

2. Knit to HTML (`knitr::knit("Sarcopenia Widgets.Rmd")` or click “Knit”).

3. View the generated `sarcopenia_dashboard.html` in your browser.

## Real-world Impact

This dashboard provides clinicians and researchers with actionable insights into sarcopenia and frailty trends among PLWH on INSTI therapy, enabling early identification of those at greatest risk. 
By visualizing longitudinal changes and subgroup differences, it supports targeted interventions and informs strategies to improve patient outcomes.
